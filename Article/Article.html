		<p class="main">As generations of kids who grew up playing video 
		games mature and become a market force, some composers 
		are looking to give game soundtracks the full symphonic 
		treatment — in the same way composers before them sought 
		to elevate and validate folk tunes.</p>

		<p class="main">The Classical era (about 1730-1820) was driven by a mostly unified
		"continental" style. Dominated by German and Austrian composers, 
		classical musicians from America, France, and Russia strived to 
		fit into this sound, mostly devoid of regional quirks and color.
		 As nationalism swept 19th century Europe, Romantic composers 
		 turned to the folk music of their home countries as inspiration.</p>
		 
		<p class="main">The Romantics, writing for new middle-class ticket-buyers and 
		not aristocratic patrons, wanted their work to bear the musical DNA 
		of their home countries. Using regional folk music as a melodic 
		starting point and then building upon those tunes using the vocabulary
		 of classical music — development, harmony, orchestrations — had two 
		 effects. It both lured middle-class audiences who once saw classical 
		 music as not written for them and also publicly declared that, say, 
		 Hungarian or Czech music had just as much "high art" value as what 
		 had long come out of Germany.</p>

		<p class="main">A little behind European nationalism, American composers like Aaron 
		Copland or the often-overlooked William Grant Still would make similar
		 declarations about their folk music heritage in the early 20th century.</p>

		<p class="main">In the 21st century, our lives have been hyper-saturated by recorded 
		music — so much so that folk tunes, usually passed down by oral tradition, 
		no longer hold as significant place in our shared musical vocabulary. For
		 subcultures like that of video gamers, though, other music can take on 
		 that role — and in many cases this is being recognized by the world of
		  classical music.</p>

		<p class="main">Like traditional folk tunes, early video game music was simple, 
		short and melody-driven. Also like folk tunes, it holds vast associative 
		value for the gamers who grew up listening to it. In many cases, listeners 
		have spent dozens if not hundreds of hours with a single soundtrack. Take, 
		for example, the Gerudo Valley theme from the 1998 Zelda: Ocarina of Time, 
		by Koji Kondo.</p>
		
		<p class="main">The tune is one of many popular themes from the Zelda franchise, but 
		musically, a compelling melody suffers from technical recording limitations
		 and the nasal MIDI trumpets that come with it. Still, a YouTube search for 
		 this theme turns up endless fan covers and remixes ranging from a capella to 
		 guitar duet to dubstep.</p>
		 
		 <p class="main">To mark the 25th anniversary of the franchise in 2011, a fully 
		 orchestrated 45-minute symphony built from the games' popular tunes — including 
		 the Gerudo Valley theme — was performed in a series of worldwide concerts.</p>
		 
		 <p class="main">The symphony is one of many orchestral takes on older game music in 
		 recent years, and in many cases, composers are approaching the game scores
		  in the same way composers do folk tunes. Conductor and arranger Andrew 
		  Skeet led the London Philharmonic Orchestra in their 2011 Greatest Video 
		  Game Music album.</p>

		<p class="main">"There are quite a few pieces on this album where I treat [the tunes] 
		like Vaughan Williams would treat folk music," Skeet said in an interview 
		with Classic FM. "I literally take eight little tunes from Sonic the Hedgehog 
		[...] and I make a suite or a tone poem from it."</p>
	
		<p class="main">As with folk tunes in classical music, game tracks can lure new audiences 
		to concert halls with a declaration that this music has value and works in 
		what might be an otherwise daunting symphonic setting. Greatest Video Game 
		Music and its sequel both placed on the Billboard Top 100 charts — a rarity 
		for orchestral albums — and video game orchestral concerts continue to draw 
		audiences.</p>

		<p class="main">Orchestrating video game themes into symphonic pieces is a continuation 
		of a well-worn classical tradition, and it may just offer some relief to 
		the financially uncertain classical world — that is, if orchestras don't 
		mind their audiences showing up in full costume.</p>
